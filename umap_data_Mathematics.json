In this\ncontribution, the discrete equivalence of Lagrangian, symplectic Hamiltonian\nand mixed formulations is investigated for linear wave propagation phenomena.\nUnder compatibility conditions between the finite elements, the Lagrangian and\nmixed formulations are indeed equivalent. For the time discretization the\nleapfrog scheme and the implicit midpoint rule are considered. In mixed methods\napplied to wave problems the primal variable (e.g. the displacement in\nmechanics or the magnetic potential in electromagnetism) is not an unknown of\nthe problem and is reconstructed a posteriori from its time derivative.

These regime shifts happen\nbecause they cross some critical value of the parameter that influences the\noverall dynamics. This critical threshold is known as tipping point. In the\nvicinity of a tipping point, perturbations gradually increases, and as a\nconsequence, system-state extensively swing around the quasi-static attractor,\nand the local dynamics become progressively slow, which is known as critical\nslowing down (CSD). Because of this CSD, statistical measures known as early\nwarning signals (EWS) such as variance and lag-1 autocorrelation increase. From\nthe point of view of physics, a free flow can become congested when the mean\ncar density crosses its tipping point. Recently, for lane-based traffic system\nusing continuum model, study reveals that analysis of the generic EWSs serve as\na good measure to predict upstream stop-and-go traffic jams. Now, we introduce\nEWSs to anticipate traffic jam for heterogeneous disordered traffic relevant\nfor non-lane-based systems. We have analyzed a lattice hydrodynamic area\noccupancy model with passing and through numerical simulations, we have shown\nemergence of kink or chaotic jam. Also, we provided proper framework for\nprediction of traffic jams via different EWSs.
