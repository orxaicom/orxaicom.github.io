To evaluate the\ncrisis consequences, we also separately analyze four subperiods and countries\nthat required financial aid from third parties and those that did not so, along\nwith large and small banks. Our results reflect the complexity of the relations\nbetween charter value, supervision, and risk.

The goal is\nto select portfolios that stochastically dominate a given benchmark but that,\nat the same time, must generate some excess return with respect to a benchmark\nindex. To achieve this goal, we propose a new methodology that selects\nportfolios using the ordered weighted average (OWA) operator, which generalizes\nprevious approaches based on minimax selection rules and still leads to solving\nlinear programming models. We also introduce a new type of approximate\nstochastic dominance rule and show that it implies the almost Second-order\nStochastic Dominance (SSD) criterion proposed by Lizyayev and Ruszczynski\n(2012). We prove that our EI model based on OWA selects portfolios that\ndominate a given benchmark through this new form of stochastic dominance\ncriterion.
