We propose a dynamic multi-period model\nthat aims to minimize transaction costs and maximize terminal wealth levels\nwhilst adhering to strict portfolio turnover constraints. Our results\ndemonstrate that using our framework in combination with a reasonable forecast,\ncan lead to higher portfolio values and lower transaction costs on average when\ncompared to a naive, single-period model. Such results were maintained given\ndifferent problem cases, such as, trading horizon, assets under management,\nwealth levels, etc. In addition, the proposed model lends itself to a\nreformulation that makes use of the column generation algorithm which can be\nstrategically leveraged to reduce complexity and solving times.", "field": "Quantitative Finance", "categories": "q-fin.CP"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.13159", "title": "Environmental impacts, nutritional profiles, and retail prices of\n  commonly sold retail food items in 181 countries: an observational study", "abstract": "Affordability is often seen as a barrier to consuming sustainable diets. This\nstudy provides the first worldwide test of how retail food prices relate to\nempirically estimated environmental impacts and nutritional profile scores\nbetween and within food groups. We use prices for 811 retail food items\ncommonly sold in 181 countries during 2011 and 2017, matched to estimated\ncarbon and water footprints and nutritional profiles, to test whether healthier\nand more environmentally sustainable foods are more expensive between and\nwithin food groups. We find that within almost all groups, less expensive items\nhave significantly lower carbon and water footprints. Associations are\nstrongest for animal source foods, where each 10% lower price is associated\nwith 20 grams lower CO2-equivalent carbon and 5 liters lower water footprint\nper 100kcal. Gradients between price and nutritional profile vary by food\ngroup, price range, and nutritional attribute. In contrast, lower-priced items\nhave lower nutritional value in only some groups over some price ranges, and\nthat relationship is sometimes reversed. These findings reveal opportunities to\nreduce financial and environmental costs of diets, contributing to transitions\ntowards healthier, more environmentally sustainable food systems.", "field": "Quantitative Finance", "categories": "econ.GN,q-fin.EC"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.13314", "title": "An Explicit Scheme for Pathwise XVA Computations", "abstract": "Motivated by the equations of cross valuation adjustments (XVAs) in the\nrealistic case where capital is deemed fungible as a source of funding for\nvariation margin, we introduce a simulation/regression scheme for a class of\nanticipated BSDEs, where the coefficient entails a conditional expected\nshortfall of the martingale part of the solution.

Based on our\nfindings, we recommend that the protocol explores implementing automatic\ncapital buffer adjustments and dynamic maturity gap matching.
