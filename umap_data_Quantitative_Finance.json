Although cryptocurrencies\nrepresent a breakthrough and provide some important benefits, their usage poses\nsome risks that are a result of the lack of supervising institutions and\ntransparency. Because disinformation and volatility is discouraging for\npersonal investors, cryptocurrencies emerged hand-in-hand with the\nproliferation of online users' communities and forums as places to share\ninformation that can alleviate users' mistrust. This research focuses on the\nstudy of the interplay between these cryptocurrency forums and fluctuations in\ncryptocurrency values. In particular, the most popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin\n(BTC) and a related active discussion community, Bitcointalk, are analyzed.\nThis study shows that the activity of Bitcointalk forum keeps a direct\nrelationship with the trend in the values of BTC, therefore analysis of this\ninteraction would be a perfect base to support personal investments in a\nnon-regulated market and, to confirm whether cryptocurrency forums show\nevidences to detect abnormal behaviors in BTC values as well as to predict or\nestimate these values. The experiment highlights that forum data can explain\nspecific events in the financial field. It also underlines the relevance of\nquotes (regular mechanism to response a post) at periods: (1) when there is a\nhigh concentration of posts around certain topics; (2) when peaks in the BTC\nprice are observed; and, (3) when the BTC price gradually shifts downwards and\nusers intend to sell.", "field": "Quantitative Finance", "categories": "q-fin.GN,cs.CY,cs.LG"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.10255", "title": "Nowcasting Madagascar's real GDP using machine learning algorithms", "abstract": "We investigate the predictive power of different machine learning algorithms\nto nowcast Madagascar's gross domestic product (GDP).

Our goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the\nsignificance and interdependence of industry clusters in shaping the dynamics\nof GDP. To achieve a more nuanced spatial differentiation, we introduce\nindicator matrices for each industry sector which allows for extending the\nspatial Durbin model to a new version of it. This approach is essential due to\nboth the economic importance of these sectors and the potential issue of\nomitted variables. Failing to account for industry sectors can lead to omitted\nvariable bias and estimation problems. To assess the effects of the major\nindustry sectors, we incorporate eight distinct branches of industry into our\nanalysis. According to prevailing economic theory, these clusters should have a\npositive impact on the regions they are associated with. Our findings indeed\nreveal highly significant impacts, which can be either positive or negative, of\nspecific sectors on local GDP growth. Spatially, we observe that direct and\nindirect effects can exhibit opposite signs, indicative of heightened\ncompetitiveness within and between industry sectors. Therefore, we recommend\nthat industry sectors should be taken into consideration when conducting\nspatial analysis of GDP.

As\none of the most widely adopted VaR models in commercial banks, Historical\nsimulation (HS) uses the empirical distribution of daily returns in a\nhistorical window as the forecast distribution of risk factor returns in the\nnext day. The objectives for financial time series generation are to generate\nsynthetic data paths with good variety, and similar distribution and dynamics\nto the original historical data. In this paper, we apply multiple existing deep\ngenerative methods (e.g., CGAN, CWGAN, Diffusion, and Signature WGAN) for\nconditional time series generation, and propose and test two new methods for\nconditional multi-step time series generation, namely Encoder-Decoder CGAN and\nConditional TimeVAE. Furthermore, we introduce a comprehensive framework with a\nset of KPIs to measure the quality of the generated time series for financial\nmodeling. The KPIs cover distribution distance, autocorrelation and\nbacktesting. All models (HS, parametric and neural networks) are tested on both\nhistorical USD yield curve data and additional data simulated from GARCH and\nCIR processes.
