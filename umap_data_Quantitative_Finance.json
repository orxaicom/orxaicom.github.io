It presents the opportunity for machines to learn, adapt, and\nperform tasks that have the potential to assist people, from everyday\nactivities to their most creative and ambitious projects. It could also help\nbusinesses and organizations harness knowledge, increase productivity,\ninnovate, transform, and power shared prosperity. This tremendous potential\nraises two fundamental questions: (1) Will AI actually advance national and\nglobal economic transformation to benefit society at large? and (2) What issues\nmust we get right to fully realize AI's economic value, expand prosperity and\nimprove lives everywhere? We explore these questions by considering the recent\nhistory of technology and innovation as a guide for the likely impact of AI and\nwhat we must do to realize its economic potential to benefit society. While we\ndo not presume the future will be entirely like that past, for reasons we will\ndiscuss, we do believe prior experience with technological change offers many\nuseful lessons. We conclude that while progress in AI presents a historic\nopportunity to advance our economic prosperity and future wellbeing, its\neconomic benefits will not come automatically and that AI risks exacerbating\nexisting economic challenges unless we collectively and purposefully act to\nenable its potential and address its challenges. We suggest a collective policy\nagenda - involving developers, deployers and users of AI, infrastructure\nproviders, policymakers, and those involved in workforce training - that may\nhelp both realize and harness AI's economic potential and address its risks to\nour shared prosperity.", "field": "Quantitative Finance", "categories": "econ.GN,q-fin.EC"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.09778", "title": "Cross-Domain Behavioral Credit Modeling: transferability from private to\n  central data", "abstract": "This paper introduces a credit risk rating model for credit risk assessment\nin quantitative finance, aiming to categorize borrowers based on their\nbehavioral data.

The model allows for the expression of uncertainty in the\nparametrisation of the stochastic dynamics and incorporates patterns to account\nfor different behaviours across various times or regimes. To establish our\nframework, we initially construct a model with random parameters, where the\nswitching between regimes can be dictated either by random variables or\ndeterministically. Such a model is highly interpretable. We further ensure\nmathematical consistency by demonstrating that the framework can be elegantly\nexpressed through local volatility models taking the form of standard jump\ndiffusions. Additionally, we consider a Markov-modulated approach for the\nswitching between regimes characterised by random parameters. For all\nconsidered models, we derive characteristic functions, providing a versatile\ntool with wide-ranging applications. In a numerical experiment, we apply the\nframework to the financial problem of option pricing.

This paper provides a systematic approach to enumerating\nthem for a quantitative spatial model with discrete locations, social\ninteractions, and elastic housing supply. The approach relies on two\nhomotopies. A homotopy is a smooth function that transforms the solutions of a\nsimpler city where solutions are known, to a city with heterogeneous locations\nand finite supply elasticity. The first homotopy is that, in the set of cities\nwith perfectly elastic floor surface supply, an economy with heterogeneous\nlocations is homotopic to an economy with homogeneous locations, whose\nsolutions can be comprehensively enumerated. Such an economy is epsilon close\nto an economy whose equilibria are the zeros of a system of polynomials. This\nis a well-studied area of mathematics where the enumeration of equilibria can\nbe guaranteed. The second homotopy is that a city with perfectly elastic\nhousing supply is homotopic to a city with an arbitrary supply elasticity. In a\nsmall number of cases, the path may bifurcate and a single path yields two or\nmore equilibria. By running the method on thousands of cities, we obtain a\nlarge number of equilibria. Each equilibrium has different population\ndistributions. We provide a method that is computationally feasible for\neconomies with a large number of locations choices, with an empirical\napplication to the City of Chicago. There exist multiple ``counterfactual\nChicagos'' consistent with the estimated parameters. Population distribution,\nprices, and welfare are not uniquely pinned down by amenities.
