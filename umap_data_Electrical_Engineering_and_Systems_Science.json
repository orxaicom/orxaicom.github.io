Currently, manual CT scan segmentation\nby radiologists is prevalent, especially for organs like the pancreas, which\nrequires a high level of domain expertise for reliable segmentation due to\nfactors like small organ size, occlusion, and varying shapes. When resorting to\nautomated pancreas segmentation, these factors translate to limited reliable\nlabeled data to train effective segmentation models. Consequently, the\nperformance of contemporary pancreas segmentation models is still not within\nacceptable ranges. To improve that, we propose M3BUNet, a fusion of MobileNet\nand U-Net neural networks, equipped with a novel Mean-Max (MM) attention that\noperates in two stages to gradually segment pancreas CT images from coarse to\nfine with mask guidance for object detection. This approach empowers the\nnetwork to surpass segmentation performance achieved by similar network\narchitectures and achieve results that are on par with complex state-of-the-art\nmethods, all while maintaining a low parameter count. Additionally, we\nintroduce external contour segmentation as a preprocessing step for the coarse\nstage to assist in the segmentation process through image standardization. For\nthe fine segmentation stage, we found that applying a wavelet decomposition\nfilter to create multi-input images enhances pancreas segmentation performance.\nWe extensively evaluate our approach on the widely known NIH pancreas dataset\nand MSD pancreas dataset. Our approach demonstrates a considerable performance\nimprovement, achieving an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) value of up\nto 89.53% and an Intersection Over Union (IOU) score of up to 81.16 for the NIH\npancreas dataset, and 88.60% DSC and 79.90% IOU for the MSD Pancreas dataset.", "field": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science", "categories": "eess.IV,cs.CV,cs.LG"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.10449", "title": "Contextualized Automatic Speech Recognition with Attention-Based Bias\n  Phrase Boosted Beam Search", "abstract": "End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) methods exhibit\nremarkable performance.
