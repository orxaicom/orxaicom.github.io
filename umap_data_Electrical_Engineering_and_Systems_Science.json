Blinded evaluation of multiple image quality metrics was performed by\ntwo working neuro-radiologists and a working neurosurgeon on a 1 to 5 Likert\nscale (1=non diagnostic, 2=poor, 3=acceptable, 4=good, 5=excellent), and the\nfavored reconstruction variant.\n  Results: The DL reconstruction was strongly favored or favored over the CS\nreconstruction for 33/40, 39/40, and 8/40 of cases for reader 1, 2, and 3,\nrespectively. Two of three readers consistently assigned higher ratings for the\nDL reconstructions, and the DL reconstructions had a higher score than their\nrespective CS counterparts for 72%, 72%, and 14% of the cases for reader 1, 2,\nand 3, respectively. Still, the DL reconstructions exhibited shortcomings such\nas a striping artifact and reduced signal.\n  Conclusion: DL shows promise to allow for high-quality reconstructions of\nintraoperative MRI with equal to or improved perceived spatial resolution,\nsignal-to-noise ratio, diagnostic confidence, diagnostic conspicuity, and\nspatial resolution compared to compressed sense.", "field": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science", "categories": "eess.IV,cs.AI,physics.med-ph"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.12822", "title": "Deep Learning Based Simulators for the Phosphorus Removal Process\n  Control in Wastewater Treatment via Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms", "abstract": "Phosphorus removal is vital in wastewater treatment to reduce reliance on\nlimited resources.
