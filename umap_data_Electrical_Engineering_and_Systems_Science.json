Among predictors based on the\nsurface electrocardiogram, the dominant frequency (DF) and harmonic exponential\ndecay (g) of the fibrillatory waves ( f -waves) have reported promising but\nclinically insufficient results. Hence, the main goal of this work was to\nconduct a broader analysis of the f -wave harmonic spectral structure to\nimprove CA outcome prediction through several entropy-based measures computed\non different frequency bands. On a database of 151 persistent AF patients under\nradio-frequency CA and a follow-up of 9 months, the newly introduced parameters\ndiscriminated between patients who relapsed to AF and those who maintained SR\nat about 70%, which was statistically superior to the DF and approximately\nsimilar to g. They also provided complementary information to g through\ndifferent combinations in multivariate models based on lineal discriminant\nanalysis and report classification performance improvement of about 5%. These\nresults suggest that the presence of larger harmonics and a proportionally\nsmaller DF peak is associated with a decreased probability of AF recurrence\nafter CA.", "field": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science", "categories": "eess.SP"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.10107", "title": "Comparison analysis between standard polysomnographic data and\n  in-ear-EEG signals: A preliminary study", "abstract": "Study Objectives: Polysomnography (PSG) currently serves as the benchmark for\nevaluating sleep disorders. Its discomfort, impracticality for home-use, and\nintroduction of bias in sleep quality assessment necessitate the exploration of\nless invasive, cost-effective, and portable alternatives. One promising\ncontender is the in-ear-EEG sensor, which offers advantages in terms of\ncomfort, fixed electrode positions, resistance to electromagnetic interference,\nand user-friendliness. This study aims to establish a methodology to assess the\nsimilarity between the in-ear-EEG signal and standard PSG.\n  Methods: We assess the agreement between the PSG and in-ear-EEG derived\nhypnograms. We extract features in the time- and frequency- domain from PSG and\nin-ear-EEG 30-second epochs. We only consider the epochs where the PSG-scorers\nand the in-ear-EEG-scorers were in agreement. We introduce a methodology to\nquantify the similarity between PSG derivations and the single-channel\nin-ear-EEG. The approach relies on a comparison of distributions of selected\nfeatures -- extracted for each sleep stage and subject on both PSG and the\nin-ear-EEG signals -- via a Jensen-Shannon Divergence Feature-based Similarity\nIndex (JSD-FSI).\n  Results: We found a high intra-scorer variability, mainly due to the\nuncertainty the scorers had in evaluating the in-ear-EEG signals. We show that\nthe similarity between PSG and in-ear-EEG signals is high (JSD-FSI: 0.61 +/-\n0.06 in awake, 0.60 +/- 0.07 in NREM and 0.51 +/- 0.08 in REM), and in line\nwith the similarity values computed independently on standard\nPSG-channel-combinations.\n  Conclusions: In-ear-EEG is a valuable solution for home-based sleep\nmonitoring, however further studies with a larger and more heterogeneous\ndataset are needed.", "field": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science", "categories": "eess.SP,cs.LG,physics.med-ph"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.10128", "title": "Sub2Full: split spectrum to boost OCT despeckling without clean data", "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) suffers from speckle noise, causing the\ndeterioration of image quality, especially in high-resolution modalities like\nvisible light OCT (vis-OCT).

However,\nsome challenges are associated with these datasets, including variability in\ndata distribution, data scarcity, and transfer learning issues when using\nmodels pre-trained from generic images. This work studies the effect of these\nchallenges at the intra- and inter-domain level in few-shot learning scenarios\nwith severe data imbalance. For this, we propose a methodology based on Siamese\nneural networks in which a series of techniques are integrated to mitigate the\neffects of data scarcity and distribution imbalance. Specifically, different\ninitialization and data augmentation methods are analyzed, and four adaptations\nto Siamese networks of solutions to deal with imbalanced data are introduced,\nincluding data balancing and weighted loss, both separately and combined, and\nwith a different balance of pairing ratios. Moreover, we also assess the\ninference process considering four classifiers, namely Histogram, $k$NN, SVM,\nand Random Forest. Evaluation is performed on three chest X-ray datasets with\nannotated cases of both positive and negative COVID-19 diagnoses. The accuracy\nof each technique proposed for the Siamese architecture is analyzed separately\nand their results are compared to those obtained using equivalent methods on a\nstate-of-the-art CNN.
