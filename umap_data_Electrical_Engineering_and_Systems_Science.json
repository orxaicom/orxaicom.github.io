Building on that, a fully differentiable\ntarget function is formulated which grades the quality of the current motion\nestimate in reconstruction space. We drastically accelerate motion estimation\nyielding a 19-fold speed-up compared to existing methods. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the architecture of networks used for quality metric regression and\npropose predicting voxel-wise quality maps, favoring autoencoder-like\narchitectures over contracting ones. This modification improves gradient flow,\nleading to more accurate motion estimation. The presented method is evaluated\nthrough realistic experiments on head anatomy. It achieves a reduction in\nreprojection error from an initial average of 3mm to 0.61mm after motion\ncompensation and consistently demonstrates superior performance compared to\nexisting approaches. The analytic Jacobian for the backprojection operation,\nwhich is at the core of the proposed method, is made publicly available. In\nsummary, this paper contributes to the advancement of CBCT integration into\nclinical workflows by proposing a robust motion estimation approach that\nenhances efficiency and accuracy, addressing critical challenges in\ntime-sensitive scenarios.", "field": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science", "categories": "eess.IV,cs.CV"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.09297", "title": "Spectral Distribution Complexity of the Surface Fibrillatory Waves\n  Predicts Post-Catheter Ablation Relapse in Persistent Atrial Fibrillation", "abstract": "As for most of cardiac arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation (AF) is primarily\ntreated by catheter ablation (CA). However, the mid-term recurrence rate of\nthis procedure in persistent AF patients is still limited and the preoperative\nprediction of its outcome is clinically interesting to select candidates who\ncould benefit the most from the intervention. This context encouraged the study\nof C0 complexity as a novel predictor, because it estimates organization of the\npower spectral distribution (PSD) of the fibrillatory waves (f-waves). For that\npurpose, the PSD was divided into two divergent components using a threshold,\ntheta, which was considered by multiplying the mean value of the PSD by a\nfactor, alpha, ranging between 1.5 and 2.5. On a database of 74 patients, the\nvalues of C0 complexity computed for all alpha factors reported statistically\nsignificant differences between the patients who maintained sinus rhythm and\nthose who relapsed to AF after a follow-up of 9 months. They also showed higher\nvalues of sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), and accuracy (Acc) than the well\nknown predictors of the dominant frequency (DF) and f-wave amplitude. Moreover,\nthe combination of the DF and the C0 complexity computed with alpha = 2, via a\ndecision tree, improved classification until values of Se, Sp and Acc of 75.33,\n77.33 and 76.58%, respectively. These results manifests the relevance of the\nf-wave PSD distribution to anticipate CA outcome in persistent AF patients.", "field": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science", "categories": "eess.SP,physics.med-ph"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.09308", "title": "Can Synthetic Data Boost the Training of Deep Acoustic Vehicle Counting\n  Networks?", "abstract": "In the design of traffic monitoring solutions for optimizing the urban\nmobility infrastructure, acoustic vehicle counting models have received\nattention due to their cost effectiveness and energy efficiency.
