However, there are three research gaps for DRL-based\nmixed-autonomy platoon control. First, incorporating safety considerations into\nDRL typically relies on designing collision avoidance-based reward functions,\nwhich lack collision-free guarantees. Second, current DRL-based-control\napproaches for mixed traffic only consider the safety of CAVs, with little\nattention paid to the surrounding HDVs. To address the research gaps, we\nintroduce a differentiable safety layer that converts DRL actions into safe\nactions with collision-free guarantees. This process relies on solving a\ndifferentiable quadratic programming problem that incorporates control barrier\nfunction-based (CBF) safety constraints for both CAV and its following HDVs to\nachieve system-level safety. Moreover, constructing CBF constraints needs\nsystem dynamics for the following HDVs, and thus we employ an online system\nidentification module to estimate the car-following dynamics of the surrounding\nHDVs. The proposed safe reinforcement learning approach explicitly integrates\nsystem-level safety constraints into the training process and enables our\nmethod to adapt to varying safety-critical scenarios.

By exploring the relationship\nbetween waveform-domain adaptive matched filtering (WD-AMF) output and\nwaveform-domain signals, we demonstrate that ISRJ can be effectively suppressed\nwhen the transmitted waveform exhibits waveform-domain complementarity. We\nintroduce a phase-coded (PC) waveform set with waveform-domain complementarity\nand propose a method for generating such waveform sets of arbitrary code\nlengths. The performance of WD-AMF are further developed due to the designed\nwaveforms, and simulations affirm the superior adaptive anti-jamming\ncapabilities of the designed waveforms compared to traditional ones.\nRemarkably, this improved performance is achieved without the need for prior\nknowledge of ISRJ interference parameters at either the transmitter or receiver\nstages.", "field": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science", "categories": "eess.SP"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.12214", "title": "Quality-Aware Hydraulic Control in Drinking Water Networks via\n  Controllability Proxies", "abstract": "The operation of water distribution networks is a complex procedure aimed at\nefficiently delivering consumers with adequate water quantity while ensuring\nits safe quality. An added challenge is the dependency of the water quality\ndynamics on the system's hydraulics, which influences the performance of the\nwater quality controller. Prior research has addressed either solving the\noptimum operational hydraulic setting problem or regulating the water quality\ndynamics as separate problems. Additionally, there have been efforts to couple\nthese two problems and solve one compact problem resulting in trade-offs\nbetween the contradictory objectives. In contrast, this paper examines the\ndependency and influence from a control-theoretic standpoint. More\nspecifically, we explore the influence of accountability for water quality\ncontrollability improvement when addressing the pump scheduling problem. We\nexamine its effects on the cumulative cost of the interconnected systems as\nwell as the subsequent performance of the water quality controller. To achieve\nthis, we develop a framework that incorporates different controllability\nmetrics within the operational hydraulic optimization problem; its aim is\nattaining an adequate level of water quality control across the system. We\nassess the aforementioned aspects' performance on various scaled networks with\na wide range of numerical scenarios.", "field": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science", "categories": "eess.SY,cs.SY"}]}
