A minimum initial rotation rate at the start of\nthe main sequence is needed to spin up the star to critical rotation within its\nmain sequence lifetime.

Furthermore, we\nfind the minimum threshold of initial angular velocity is lower for SMC\nmetallicity compared to Galactic metallicity, which is in agreement with the\nincreased fraction in the number of observed Be stars in lower metallicity\nenvironments.

While the term foundation model has quickly garnered\ninterest from the geospatial domain, its definition remains vague.

Built upon the tremendous success achieved by Large Language\nModels (LLMs) as the foundation models for language tasks, this paper discusses\nthe challenges of building foundation models for geospatial artificial\nintelligence (GeoAI) vision tasks. To evaluate the performance of large AI\nvision models, especially Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM), we implemented\ndifferent instance segmentation pipelines that minimize the changes to SAM to\nleverage its power as a foundation model. A series of prompt strategies was\ndeveloped to test SAM's performance regarding its theoretical upper bound of\npredictive accuracy, zero-shot performance, and domain adaptability through\nfine-tuning. The analysis used two permafrost feature datasets, ice-wedge\npolygons and retrogressive thaw slumps because (1) these landform features are\nmore challenging to segment than manmade features due to their complicated\nformation mechanisms, diverse forms, and vague boundaries; (2) their presence\nand changes are important indicators for Arctic warming and climate change. The\nresults show that although promising, SAM still has room for improvement to\nsupport AI-augmented terrain mapping.

Over the life of a file system, this may cause\nsuboptimal file placement decisions that eventually lead to slower performance,\nor aging. Conventional wisdom suggests that file system aging is a solved\nproblem in the common case; heuristics to avoid aging, such as colocating\nrelated files and data blocks, are effective until a storage device fills up,\nat which point space pressure exacerbates fragmentation-based aging. However,\nthis article describes both realistic and synthetic workloads that can cause\nthese heuristics to fail, inducing large performance declines due to aging,\neven when the storage device is nearly empty.\n  We argue that these slowdowns are caused by poor layout. We demonstrate a\ncorrelation between the read performance of a directory scan and the locality\nwithin a file system's access patterns, using a dynamic layout score. We\ncomplement these results with microbenchmarks that show that space pressure can\ncause a substantial amount of inter-file and intra-file fragmentation. However,\nour results suggest that the effect of free-space fragmentation on read\nperformance is best described as accelerating the file system aging process.\nThe effect on write performance is non-existent in some cases, and, in most\ncases, an order of magnitude smaller than the read degradation from\nfragmentation caused by normal usage.\n  In short, many file systems are exquisitely prone to read aging after a\nvariety of write patterns. We show, however, that aging is not inevitable.\nBetrFS, a file system based on write-optimized dictionaries, exhibits almost no\naging in our experiments.

We hypothesize that insurance sector growth positively propels economic\ngrowth due to its economic growth-supportive traits like investment protection\nand optimal risk mitigation. We also claim that Nighttime light data is a good\neconomic measure than Gross domestic product (GDP). We used weighted\nregressions to measure the relationships between nighttime light data, GDP, and\ninsurance sector development. We used time series South African GDP data\ncollected from the World Bank for the period running from 2000 to 2018, and the\nnighttime lights data from the National Geophysical Data Centre (NGDC) in\npartnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\nFrom the models fitted and the reported BIC, AIC, and likelihood ratios, the\ninsurance sector proved to have more predictive power on economic development\nin South Africa, and radiance light explained economic growth better than GDP\nand GDP/Capita. We concluded that nighttime data is a good proxy for economic\ngrowth than GDP/Capita in emerging economies like South Africa, where secondary\ndata needs to be more robust and sometimes inflated. The findings will guide\nresearchers and policymakers on what drives economic development and what\npolicies to put in place.
