We compare and contrast general features of our methodology\nwith other common practices and emphasize the improvements derived from our\napproach that we view as essential for applications where extracting details of\nnonperturbative transverse hadron structure is a major goal. These include the\nHSO's preservation of a basic TMD parton-model-like framework even while\naccounting for full TMD factorization and evolution, explicit preservation of\nthe integral relationship between TMD and collinear pdfs, and the ability to\nmeaningfully compare different theoretical models of nonperturbative TMD parton\ndistributions. In our examples, we show that there is significant sensitivity\nat moderate $Q^2$ to both the form of the nonperturbative transverse momentum\ndependence and the parametrization of collinear parton densities. However, we\nalso find that evolving to $Q^2 = M_Z^2$, without fitting, results in a\nsatisfactory postdiction of existing data for $Z^0$ production, nearly\nindependently of the modeling of nonperturbative transverse momentum behavior.\nWe argue that this demonstrates that moderate $Q$ measurements should be given\ngreater weight than high $Q$ measurements in extractions of nonperturbative\ntransverse momentum dependence.

We\ndemonstrate that due to interactions between the temperature and other model\nparameters via some partial differential equations, the convergence rates of\nparameter estimations are slower than any polynomial rates, and could be as\nslow as $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\log(n))$, where $n$ denotes the sample size. To address\nthis issue, we propose using a novel activation dense-to-sparse gate, which\nroutes the output of a linear layer to an activation function before delivering\nthem to the softmax function.

Furthermore, we introduce a repainting\ntechnique during the inference of the diffusion process, enabling the proposed\nmodel to regenerate high-frequency components even in mismatched conditions. An\nadditional contribution is the collection of and evaluation on real SR\nrecordings, using the same microphone at different native sampling rates.
