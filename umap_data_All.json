However, white noise, where all noise frequencies\ncontribute equally in the power spectral density, is not a realistic noise\nprofile as lower frequencies generally dominate the spectrum. Furthermore, the\nLindblad equation does not fully describe the system as a density matrix $\\rho$\ndoes not uniquely describe a probabilistic ensemble of pure states\n$\\{\\psi_j\\}_j$. In this work, we introduce a method for solving for the full\ndistribution of qubit fidelity driven by important stochastic Schr\\\"odinger\nequation cases, where qubits evolve under more realistic noise profiles, e.g.\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck noise. This allows for predictions of the mean, variance,\nand higher-order moments of the fidelities of these qubits, which can be of\nvalue when deciding on the allowed noise levels for future quantum computing\nsystems, e.g. deciding what quality of control systems to procure.

Thus, this paper investigates the performance of various\nRIS technologies like regular (reflective and passive), simultaneously transmit\nand reflect (STAR), and multi-sector beyond diagonal (BD) RIS in multi-user\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OFDM broadcast channels (BC). This\nrequires to formulate and solve a joint MIMO precoding and RIS optimization\nproblem. The obtained solution reveals that RIS can significantly improve the\nsystem performance even when the number of RIS elements is relatively low.\nMoreover, we develop resource allocation schemes for STAR-RIS and multi-sector\nBD-RIS in MIMO OFDM BCs, and show that these RIS technologies can outperform a\nregular RIS, especially when the regular RIS cannot assist the communications\nfor all the users.", "field": "Mathematics", "categories": "cs.IT,eess.SP,math.IT"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.11925", "title": "Large deviations of the empirical spectral measure of supercritical\n  sparse Wigner matrices", "abstract": "Let $\\Xi$ be the adjacency matrix of an Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graph on $n$\nvertices and with parameter $p$ and consider $A$ a $n\\times n$ centered random\nsymmetric matrix with bounded i.i.d. entries above the diagonal.
