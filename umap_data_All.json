Despite its\nattractiveness, several drawbacks for its industrialization are related to\ndifferent form of surface and bulk instabilities. These instabilities are due\nto redox process involving the charge transfer between cations and anions.\nTherefore, a fundamental understanding based on further experimental evidence\nis required to resolve of charge transfer between the cation and anion from the\nsurface to the bulk in LiNiO2. Herein, we resolve the role of nickel and oxygen\nin the charge compensation process in LixNiO2 electrodes from the extreme\nsurface down to 30 nm by energy-dependent core-level HAXPES supported by ab\ninitio simulation. We emphasize the central role of oxygen in the bulk charge\ncompensation mechanism from LiNiO2 to NiO2 due to the negative charge transfer\nand bond/charge-disproportionation characters of LiNiO2.

To monitor such a severe MSD, a\nsegmentation map of the femur, tibia and tibiofemoral cartilage is usually\naccessed using the automated segmentation algorithm from the Magnetic Resonance\nImaging (MRI) of the knee. But, in recent works, such segmentation is\nconceivable only from the multistage framework thus creating data handling\nissues and needing continuous manual inference rendering it unable to make a\nquick and precise clinical diagnosis. In order to solve these issues, in this\npaper the Multi-Resolution Attentive-Unet (MtRA-Unet) is proposed to segment\nthe femur, tibia and tibiofemoral cartilage automatically. The proposed work\nhas included a novel Multi-Resolution Feature Fusion (MRFF) and Shape\nReconstruction (SR) loss that focuses on multi-contextual information and\nstructural anatomical details of the femur, tibia and tibiofemoral cartilage.\nUnlike previous approaches, the proposed work is a single-stage and end-to-end\nframework producing a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 98.5% for the femur,\n98.4% for the tibia, 89.1% for Femoral Cartilage (FC) and 86.1% for Tibial\nCartilage (TC) for critical MRI slices that can be helpful to clinicians for\nKOA grading. The time to segment MRI volume (160 slices) per subject is 22 sec.\nwhich is one of the fastest among state-of-the-art.

Existing\nsegmentation-based methods separate the surface registration from the surface\nextraction, which is computationally inefficient and prone to distortions. We\nintroduce Vox2Cortex-Flow (V2C-Flow), a deep mesh-deformation technique that\nlearns a deformation field from a brain template to the cortical surfaces of an\nMRI scan. To this end, we present a geometric neural network that models the\ndeformation-describing ordinary differential equation in a continuous manner.\nThe network architecture comprises convolutional and graph-convolutional\nlayers, which allows it to work with images and meshes at the same time.\nV2C-Flow is not only very fast, requiring less than two seconds to infer all\nfour cortical surfaces, but also establishes vertex-wise correspondences to the\ntemplate during reconstruction. In addition, V2C-Flow is the first approach for\ncortex reconstruction that models white matter and pial surfaces jointly,\ntherefore avoiding intersections between them. Our comprehensive experiments on\ninternal and external test data demonstrate that V2C-Flow results in cortical\nsurfaces that are state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy.
