One of the main applications of HOMERUN is the accurate determination of\ngas-phase metallicities and we show that a critical point is to allow for a\nvariation of the N/O and S/O abundance ratios which can significantly improve\nthe quality of the fit and the accuracy of the results.

To do this, modern IR\nsystems typically deploy a re-ranking pipeline in which a set of documents is\nretrieved by a lightweight first-stage retrieval process and then re-ranked by\na more effective but expensive model. However, the success of a re-ranking\npipeline is heavily dependent on the performance of the first stage retrieval,\nsince new documents are not usually identified during the re-ranking stage.\nMoreover, this can impact the amount of exposure that a particular group of\ndocuments, such as documents from a particular demographic group, can receive\nin the final ranking. For example, the fair allocation of exposure becomes more\nchallenging or impossible if the first stage retrieval returns too few\ndocuments from certain groups, since the number of group documents in the\nranking affects the exposure more than the documents' positions. With this in\nmind, it is beneficial to predict the amount of exposure that a group of\ndocuments is likely to receive in the results of the first stage retrieval\nprocess, in order to ensure that there are a sufficient number of documents\nincluded from each of the groups. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of\nquery exposure prediction (QEP). Specifically, we propose the first approach\nfor predicting the distribution of exposure that groups of documents will\nreceive for a given query. Our new approach, called GEP, uses lexical\ninformation from individual groups of documents to estimate the exposure the\ngroups will receive in a ranking. Our experiments on the TREC 2021 and 2022\nFair Ranking Track test collections show that our proposed GEP approach results\nin exposure predictions that are up to 40 % more accurate than the predictions\nof adapted existing query performance prediction and resource allocation\napproaches.", "field": "Computer Science", "categories": "cs.IR"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.13438", "title": "Keeping Energy-Neutral Devices Operational: a Coherent Massive\n  Beamforming Approach", "abstract": "Keeping the batteries on the shelf: this is the holy grail for low-cost\nInternet of Things (IoT) nodes.

In this context, the use of AI-powered remote biometric\nidentification (RBI) systems is a much-discussed technology. RBI systems are\nused to identify criminal activity in public spaces, but are criticised for\ninheriting biases and violating fundamental human rights. It is therefore\nimportant to ensure that such systems are developed in the public interest,\nwhich means that any technology that is deployed for public use needs to be\nscrutinised. While there is a consensus among business leaders, policymakers\nand scientists that AI must be developed in an ethical and trustworthy manner,\nscholars have argued that ethical guidelines do not guarantee ethical AI, but\nrather prevent stronger regulation of AI. As a possible counterweight, public\nopinion can have a decisive influence on policymakers to establish boundaries\nand conditions under which AI systems should be used -- if at all. However, we\nknow little about the conditions that lead to regulatory demand for AI systems.\nIn this study, we focus on the role of trust in AI as well as trust in law\nenforcement as potential factors that may lead to demands for regulation of AI\ntechnology. In addition, we explore the mediating effects of discrimination\nperceptions regarding RBI. We test the effects on four different use cases of\nRBI varying the temporal aspect (real-time vs. post hoc analysis) and purpose\nof use (persecution of criminals vs. safeguarding public events) in a survey\namong German citizens. We found that German citizens do not differentiate\nbetween the different modes of application in terms of their demand for RBI\nregulation. Furthermore, we show that perceptions of discrimination lead to a\ndemand for stronger regulation, while trust in AI and trust in law enforcement\nlead to opposite effects in terms of demand for a ban on RBI systems.", "field": "Computer Science", "categories": "cs.CY"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.13606", "title": "Run-to-Run Control With Bayesian Optimization for Soft Landing of\n  Short-Stroke Reluctance Actuators", "abstract": "There is great interest in minimizing the impact forces of reluctance\nactuators during commutations, in order to reduce contact bouncing, acoustic\nnoise and mechanical wear.
