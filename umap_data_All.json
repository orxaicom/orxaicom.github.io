Motivated by this, a\nsurge of robust models is crafted to enhance the adversarial robustness of\ngraph neural networks on homophilic graphs. However, the vulnerability based on\nheterophilic graphs remains a mystery to us. To bridge this gap, in this paper,\nwe start to explore the vulnerability of graph neural networks on heterophilic\ngraphs and theoretically prove that the update of the negative classification\nloss is negatively correlated with the pairwise similarities based on the\npowered aggregated neighbor features. This theoretical proof explains the\nempirical observations that the graph attacker tends to connect dissimilar node\npairs based on the similarities of neighbor features instead of ego features\nboth on homophilic and heterophilic graphs. In this way, we novelly introduce a\nnovel robust model termed NSPGNN which incorporates a dual-kNN graphs pipeline\nto supervise the neighbor similarity-guided propagation. This propagation\nutilizes the low-pass filter to smooth the features of node pairs along the\npositive kNN graphs and the high-pass filter to discriminate the features of\nnode pairs along the negative kNN graphs.

In this paper, we aim to address the limitations and\nnuances surrounding the evaluation of finishing skill using xG statistics.\nSpecifically, we explore three hypotheses: (1) the deviation between actual and\nexpected goals is an inadequate metric due to the high variance of shot\noutcomes and limited sample sizes, (2) the inclusion of all shots in cumulative\nxG calculation may be inappropriate, and (3) xG models contain biases arising\nfrom interdependencies in the data that affect skill measurement. We found that\nsustained overperformance of cumulative xG requires both high shot volumes and\nexceptional finishing, including all shot types can obscure the finishing\nability of proficient strikers, and that there is a persistent bias that makes\nthe actual and expected goals closer for excellent finishers than it really is.\nOverall, our analysis indicates that we need more nuanced quantitative\napproaches for investigating a player's finishing ability, which we achieved\nusing a technique from AI fairness to learn an xG model that is calibrated for\nmultiple subgroups of players. As a concrete use case, we show that (1) the\nstandard biased xG model underestimates Messi's GAX by 17% and (2) Messi's GAX\nis 27% higher than the typical elite high-shot-volume attacker, indicating that\nMessi is even a more exceptional finisher than people commonly believed.", "field": "Computer Science", "categories": "cs.LG,stat.AP"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.09942", "title": "Multi-task Learning for Joint Re-identification, Team Affiliation, and\n  Role Classification for Sports Visual Tracking", "abstract": "Effective tracking and re-identification of players is essential for\nanalyzing soccer videos.

A key\nchallenge is the assumption that diverse devices can uniformly benefit from a\nstandard, large DL model in SemCom systems. This assumption becomes\nincreasingly impractical, especially in high-speed, high-reliability\napplications such as industrial automation or critical healthcare. Therefore,\nthis paper introduces a novel SemCom framework tailored for heterogeneous,\nresource-constrained edge devices and computation-intensive servers. Our\napproach employs dynamic knowledge distillation (KD) to customize semantic\nmodels for each device, balancing computational and communication constraints\nwhile ensuring Quality of Service (QoS). We formulate an optimization problem\nand develop an adaptive algorithm that iteratively refines semantic knowledge\non edge devices, resulting in better models tailored to their resource\nprofiles. This algorithm strategically adjusts the granularity of distilled\nknowledge, enabling devices to maintain high semantic accuracy for precise\ninference tasks, even under unstable network conditions. Extensive simulations\ndemonstrate that our approach significantly reduces model complexity for edge\ndevices, leading to better semantic extraction and achieving the desired QoS.", "field": "Computer Science", "categories": "cs.NI"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.10215", "title": "GPAvatar: Generalizable and Precise Head Avatar from Image(s)", "abstract": "Head avatar reconstruction, crucial for applications in virtual reality,\nonline meetings, gaming, and film industries, has garnered substantial\nattention within the computer vision community.

It could also help\nbusinesses and organizations harness knowledge, increase productivity,\ninnovate, transform, and power shared prosperity. This tremendous potential\nraises two fundamental questions: (1) Will AI actually advance national and\nglobal economic transformation to benefit society at large? and (2) What issues\nmust we get right to fully realize AI's economic value, expand prosperity and\nimprove lives everywhere? We explore these questions by considering the recent\nhistory of technology and innovation as a guide for the likely impact of AI and\nwhat we must do to realize its economic potential to benefit society. While we\ndo not presume the future will be entirely like that past, for reasons we will\ndiscuss, we do believe prior experience with technological change offers many\nuseful lessons. We conclude that while progress in AI presents a historic\nopportunity to advance our economic prosperity and future wellbeing, its\neconomic benefits will not come automatically and that AI risks exacerbating\nexisting economic challenges unless we collectively and purposefully act to\nenable its potential and address its challenges.

This paper provides a systematic approach to enumerating\nthem for a quantitative spatial model with discrete locations, social\ninteractions, and elastic housing supply. The approach relies on two\nhomotopies. A homotopy is a smooth function that transforms the solutions of a\nsimpler city where solutions are known, to a city with heterogeneous locations\nand finite supply elasticity. The first homotopy is that, in the set of cities\nwith perfectly elastic floor surface supply, an economy with heterogeneous\nlocations is homotopic to an economy with homogeneous locations, whose\nsolutions can be comprehensively enumerated. Such an economy is epsilon close\nto an economy whose equilibria are the zeros of a system of polynomials. This\nis a well-studied area of mathematics where the enumeration of equilibria can\nbe guaranteed. The second homotopy is that a city with perfectly elastic\nhousing supply is homotopic to a city with an arbitrary supply elasticity. In a\nsmall number of cases, the path may bifurcate and a single path yields two or\nmore equilibria. By running the method on thousands of cities, we obtain a\nlarge number of equilibria. Each equilibrium has different population\ndistributions. We provide a method that is computationally feasible for\neconomies with a large number of locations choices, with an empirical\napplication to the City of Chicago. There exist multiple ``counterfactual\nChicagos'' consistent with the estimated parameters. Population distribution,\nprices, and welfare are not uniquely pinned down by amenities. The paper's\nmethod can be applied to models in trade and IO.
