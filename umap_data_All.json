It has recently been shown that insulating domain\nwalls in ferroelectrics can act as such barriers. One advantage domain walls\nhave, in comparison to stationary interfaces, is that they can be moved,\noffering the potential of post-synthesis control of the dielectric constant.\nHowever, to date, direct imaging of how changes in domain wall pattern cause a\nchange in dielectric constant within a single sample has not been realized. In\nthis work, we demonstrate that changing the domain wall density allows the\nengineering of the dielectric constant in hexagonal-ErMnO3 single crystals. The\nchanges of the domain wall density are quantified via microscopy techniques,\nwhile the dielectric constant is determined via macroscopic dielectric\nspectroscopy measurements. The observed changes in the dielectric constant are\nquantitatively consistent with the observed variation in domain wall density,\nimplying that the insulating domain walls behave as 'ideal' capacitors\nconnected in series. Our approach to engineer the domain wall density can be\nreadily extended to other control methods, e.g., electric fields or mechanical\nstresses, providing a novel degree of flexibility to in-situ tune the\ndielectric constant.", "field": "Physics", "categories": "cond-mat.mtrl-sci"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.10855", "title": "Nature of the unconventional heavy fermion Kondo state in monolayer\n  CeSiI", "abstract": "CeSiI has been recently isolated in the ultrathin limit, establishing CeSiI\nas the first intrinsic two-dimensional van der Waals heavy-fermion material up\nto 85 K.

We observe that between all inputs, almost all of\nthe perturbation sensitivities for Trajectron++ lie only within the most recent\nstate history time point, while perturbation sensitivities for AgentFormer are\nspread across state histories over time. We additionally demonstrate that,\ndespite dominant sensitivity on state history perturbations, an undetectable\nimage map perturbation made with the Fast Gradient Sign Method can induce large\nprediction error increases in both models. Even though image maps may\ncontribute slightly to the prediction output of both models, this result\nreveals that rather than being robust to adversarial image perturbations,\ntrajectory predictors are susceptible to image attacks.

We investigate two simple yet effective strategies that\nmake data scaling-up promising. First, a more challenging optimization target\nis created by leveraging data augmentation tools. It compels the model to\nactively seek extra visual knowledge and acquire robust representations.\nSecond, an auxiliary supervision is developed to enforce the model to inherit\nrich semantic priors from pre-trained encoders.

However, this assumption does not always hold, as many studies in the\nliterature report non-deterministic computational simulations (also known as\nnoisy models). In such cases, running the simulations multiple times with the\nsame input will result in different outputs. Similarly, data-driven models that\nrely on real-world data may also be affected by noise. This characteristic\nposes a challenge when performing reliability analysis, as many classical\nmethods, such as FORM and SORM, are tailored to deterministic models. To bridge\nthis gap, this paper provides a novel methodology to perform reliability\nanalysis on models contaminated by noise. In such cases, noise introduces\nlatent uncertainty into the reliability estimator, leading to an incorrect\nestimation of the real underlying reliability index, even when using Monte\nCarlo simulation. To overcome this challenge, we propose the use of denoising\nregression-based surrogate models within an active learning reliability\nanalysis framework.

According to prevailing economic theory, these clusters should have a\npositive impact on the regions they are associated with. Our findings indeed\nreveal highly significant impacts, which can be either positive or negative, of\nspecific sectors on local GDP growth. Spatially, we observe that direct and\nindirect effects can exhibit opposite signs, indicative of heightened\ncompetitiveness within and between industry sectors. Therefore, we recommend\nthat industry sectors should be taken into consideration when conducting\nspatial analysis of GDP. Doing so allows for a more comprehensive understanding\nof the economic dynamics at play.", "field": "Economics", "categories": "econ.GN,econ.EM,q-fin.EC"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.10473", "title": "Dynamic Programming: Finite States", "abstract": "This book is about dynamic programming and its applications in economics,\nfinance, and adjacent fields.

Experimental participants are informed of everyone's\npreferences and can make arbitrary non-binding match offers that get finalized\nwhen a period of market inactivity has elapsed. Several insights emerge. First,\nstable outcomes are prevalent. Second, while centralized clearinghouses\ncommonly aim at implementing extremal stable matchings, our decentralized\nmarkets most frequently culminate in the median stable matching. Third,\npreferences' cardinal representations impact the stable partners participants\nmatch with.
