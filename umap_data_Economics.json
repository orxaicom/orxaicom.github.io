This\nstudy provides the first worldwide test of how retail food prices relate to\nempirically estimated environmental impacts and nutritional profile scores\nbetween and within food groups. We use prices for 811 retail food items\ncommonly sold in 181 countries during 2011 and 2017, matched to estimated\ncarbon and water footprints and nutritional profiles, to test whether healthier\nand more environmentally sustainable foods are more expensive between and\nwithin food groups. We find that within almost all groups, less expensive items\nhave significantly lower carbon and water footprints. Associations are\nstrongest for animal source foods, where each 10% lower price is associated\nwith 20 grams lower CO2-equivalent carbon and 5 liters lower water footprint\nper 100kcal. Gradients between price and nutritional profile vary by food\ngroup, price range, and nutritional attribute. In contrast, lower-priced items\nhave lower nutritional value in only some groups over some price ranges, and\nthat relationship is sometimes reversed.

This\npaper introduces an advancement to the traditional stochastic volatility model,\ntermed the realized stochastic volatility model, which integrates realized\nvolatility as a precise estimator of volatility. To capture the well-known\ncharacteristics of return distribution, namely skewness and heavy tails, we\nincorporate three types of skew-t distributions. Among these, two distributions\ninclude the skew-normal feature, offering enhanced flexibility in modeling the\nreturn distribution. We employ a Bayesian estimation approach using the Markov\nchain Monte Carlo method and apply it to major stock indices. Our empirical\nanalysis, utilizing data from US and Japanese stock indices, indicates that the\ninclusion of both skewness and heavy tails in daily returns significantly\nimproves the accuracy of volatility and quantile forecasts.", "field": "Economics", "categories": "econ.EM"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.1337", "title": "New accessibility measures based on unconventional big data sources", "abstract": "In health econometric studies we are often interested in quantifying aspects\nrelated to the accessibility to medical infrastructures.
