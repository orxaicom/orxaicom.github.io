We trained popular\nregression models, including linear regularized regression (Ridge, Lasso,\nElastic-net), dimensionality reduction model (principal component regression),\nk-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN regression), support vector regression\n(linear SVR), and tree-based ensemble models (Random forest and XGBoost\nregressions), on 10 Malagasy quarterly macroeconomic leading indicators over\nthe period 2007Q1--2022Q4, and we used simple econometric models as a\nbenchmark. We measured the nowcast accuracy of each model by calculating the\nroot mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute\npercentage error (MAPE). Our findings reveal that the Ensemble Model, formed by\naggregating individual predictions, consistently outperforms traditional\neconometric models. We conclude that machine learning models can deliver more\naccurate and timely nowcasts of Malagasy economic performance and provide\npolicymakers with additional guidance for data-driven decision making.", "field": "Economics", "categories": "econ.GN,cs.LG,q-fin.EC,91-10, 62P20"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.10261", "title": "How industrial clusters influence the growth of the regional GDP: A\n  spatial-approach", "abstract": "In this paper, we employ spatial econometric methods to analyze panel data\nfrom German NUTS 3 regions. Our goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the\nsignificance and interdependence of industry clusters in shaping the dynamics\nof GDP. To achieve a more nuanced spatial differentiation, we introduce\nindicator matrices for each industry sector which allows for extending the\nspatial Durbin model to a new version of it. This approach is essential due to\nboth the economic importance of these sectors and the potential issue of\nomitted variables. Failing to account for industry sectors can lead to omitted\nvariable bias and estimation problems. To assess the effects of the major\nindustry sectors, we incorporate eight distinct branches of industry into our\nanalysis. According to prevailing economic theory, these clusters should have a\npositive impact on the regions they are associated with. Our findings indeed\nreveal highly significant impacts, which can be either positive or negative, of\nspecific sectors on local GDP growth. Spatially, we observe that direct and\nindirect effects can exhibit opposite signs, indicative of heightened\ncompetitiveness within and between industry sectors. Therefore, we recommend\nthat industry sectors should be taken into consideration when conducting\nspatial analysis of GDP.
