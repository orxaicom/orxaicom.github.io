A Nighttime\n  light data approach", "abstract": "This paper uses nighttime light(NTL) data to measure the nexus of the\nnon-banking sector, particularly insurance, and economic growth in South\nAfrica. We hypothesize that insurance sector growth positively propels economic\ngrowth due to its economic growth-supportive traits like investment protection\nand optimal risk mitigation. We also claim that Nighttime light data is a good\neconomic measure than Gross domestic product (GDP). We used weighted\nregressions to measure the relationships between nighttime light data, GDP, and\ninsurance sector development. We used time series South African GDP data\ncollected from the World Bank for the period running from 2000 to 2018, and the\nnighttime lights data from the National Geophysical Data Centre (NGDC) in\npartnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\nFrom the models fitted and the reported BIC, AIC, and likelihood ratios, the\ninsurance sector proved to have more predictive power on economic development\nin South Africa, and radiance light explained economic growth better than GDP\nand GDP/Capita. We concluded that nighttime data is a good proxy for economic\ngrowth than GDP/Capita in emerging economies like South Africa, where secondary\ndata needs to be more robust and sometimes inflated. The findings will guide\nresearchers and policymakers on what drives economic development and what\npolicies to put in place.

The ranking is based on three pillars:\ninfrastructure, education, and finance. Infrastructure is measured by the\navailability of electricity, high-speed internet, the quality of\ntelecommunications networks, and the availability of supercomputers. Education\nis measured by the quality of education and the research status. Finance is\nmeasured by the cost of investments, history of investments, economic metrics,\nand current implementation of AI.\n  While Brazil, Chile, and Mexico have established themselves as major players\nin the AI industry in Latin America, our ranking demonstrates the new emerging\npowers in the region. According to the results, Argentina, Colombia, Uruguay,\nCosta Rica, and Ecuador are leading as new emerging powers in AI in Latin\nAmerica.
