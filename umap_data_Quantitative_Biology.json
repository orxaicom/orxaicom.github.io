However,\nadvancements in biotechnology, computational methods, and machine learning\nalgorithms have the potential to revolutionize drug discovery, speeding up the\nprocess and improving patient outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further\naccelerated and deepened the recognition of the potential of these techniques,\nespecially in the areas of drug repurposing and efficacy predictions.\nMeanwhile, non-small molecule therapeutic modalities such as cell therapies,\nmonoclonal antibodies, and RNA interference (RNAi) technology have gained\nimportance due to their ability to target specific disease pathways and/or\npatient populations. In the field of RNAi, many experiments have been carried\nout to design and select highly efficient siRNAs. However, the established\npatterns for efficient siRNAs are sometimes contradictory and unable to\nconsistently determine the most potent siRNA molecules against a target mRNA.\nThus, this paper focuses on developing machine learning models based on the\ncheminformatics representation of the nucleotide composition (i.e. AUTGC) of\nsiRNA to predict their potency and aid the selection of the most efficient\nsiRNAs for further development. The PLS (Partial Least Square) and SVR (Support\nVector Regression) machine learning models built in this work outperformed\npreviously published models. These models can help in predicting siRNA potency\nand aid in selecting the best siRNA molecules for experimental validation and\nfurther clinical development. The study has demonstrated the potential of\nAI/machine learning models to help expedite siRNA-based drug discovery\nincluding the discovery of potent siRNAs against SARS-CoV-2.", "field": "Quantitative Biology", "categories": "q-bio.BM,cs.LG"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.12245", "title": "Hypochaos prevents tragedy of the commons in discrete-time\n  eco-evolutionary game dynamics", "abstract": "While quite a few recent papers have explored game-resource feedback using\nthe framework of evolutionary game theory, almost all the studies are confined\nto using time-continuous dynamical equations.

In the light of our\nfinding that sometimes chaos is confined exclusively to either the dynamics of\nthe resource or that of the consumer fractions, an interesting scenario is\nrealized: The resource state can keep oscillating chaotically, and hence, it\ndoes not vanish to result in the tragedy of the commons, extinction of the\nresource due to selfish indiscriminate exploitation, and yet the consumer\npopulation, whose dynamics depends directly on the state of the resource, may\nend up being composed exclusively of defectors, i.e., high harvesters.

Indeed, an artificial modification of the perceived\ndimensions of the body changes the tactile perception of external object\ndimensions. However, it is unknown if such a change in tactile perception would\noccur when the body schema is modified through the illusion of owning an limb\naltered in size.

Additionally, significant effect of elongation found on TDP\nbut not on proprioception suggests that these are affected differently by body\nschema modifications.

Therefore, whether the language control network is stable or not\nremains unclear. In the present study, we directly evaluated the stability and\ninstability of the language control network using resting-state functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). We employed cohorts of Chinese first-year\ncollege students majoring in English who underwent second language (L2)\nacquisition courses at a university and those who did not. Two resting-state\nfMRI scans were acquired approximately 1 year apart. We found that the language\ncontrol network was both moderately stable and unstable. We further\ninvestigated the morphological coexistence patterns of stability and\ninstability within the language control network. First, we extracted\nconnections representing stability and plasticity from the entire network. We\nthen evaluated whether the coexistence patterns were modular (stability and\ninstability involve different brain regions) or non-modular (stability and\nplasticity involve the same brain regions but have unique connectivity\npatterns). We found that both stability and instability coexisted in a\nnon-modular pattern. Compared with the non-English major group, the English\nmajor group has a more non-modular coexistence pattern..
