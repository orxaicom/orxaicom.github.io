A\ncontribution of the work is a thorough category-theoretic formalisation of our\nframework. We claim that the use of category theory, and in particular the use\nof string diagrams to describe quantum processes, helps elucidate some of the\nmost important features of our approach. We build upon Gardenfors' classical\nframework of conceptual spaces, in which cognition is modelled geometrically\nthrough the use of convex spaces, which in turn factorise in terms of simpler\nspaces called domains. We show how concepts from the domains of shape, colour,\nsize and position can be learned from images of simple shapes, where concepts\nare represented as Gaussians in the classical implementation, and quantum\neffects in the quantum one. In the classical case we develop a new model which\nis inspired by the Beta-VAE model of concepts, but is designed to be more\nclosely connected with language, so that the names of concepts form part of the\ngraphical model. In the quantum case, concepts are learned by a hybrid\nclassical-quantum network trained to perform concept classification, where the\nclassical image processing is carried out by a convolutional neural network and\nthe quantum representations are produced by a parameterised quantum circuit.\nFinally, we consider the question of whether our quantum models of concepts can\nbe considered conceptual spaces in the Gardenfors sense.", "field": "Quantitative Biology", "categories": "q-bio.NC,cs.AI,quant-ph"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.08605", "title": "Long cycles in linear processing systems", "abstract": "Linear thresholding systems have been used as a model of neural activation\nand more recently proposed as a model of gene regulation.
