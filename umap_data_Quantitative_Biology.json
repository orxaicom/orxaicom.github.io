Due to\nthe assumed two-phase nature of blood and specific features of red blood cells\n(RBCs), mathematical models for blood flow in the microcirculation are highly\nnonlinear, coupling the flow and RBC concentrations (haematocrit). In contrast\nto previous works which accomplished blood-flow homogenisation by assuming that\nthe haematocrit level remains constant, here we allow for spatial heterogeneity\nin the haematocrit concentration and thus begin with a nonlinear microscale\nmodel. We simplify the analysis by considering the limit of small haematocrit\nheterogeneity which prevails when variations in haematocrit concentration\nbetween neighbouring vessels are small. Homogenisation results in a system of\ncoupled, nonlinear partial differential equations describing the flow and\nhaematocrit transport at the macroscale, in which a nonlinear Darcy-type model\nrelates the flow and pressure gradient via a haematocrit-dependent permeability\ntensor. During the analysis we obtain further that haematocrit transport at the\nmacroscale is governed by a purely advective equation.
