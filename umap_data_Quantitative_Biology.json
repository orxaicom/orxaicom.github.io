The importance of adaptive thermoregulatory\n  flexibility for the Malagasy bat species Triaenops menamena", "abstract": "The balance between energy intake and expenditure is essential and crucial\nfor survival for all organisms. The energy management is closely linked to the\necology. Thus, changes in environmental conditions can be challenging,\nespecially for the animals physiology. Different strategies of thermoregulation\nhave evolved and heterothermy seems to be the most efficient way for saving\nenergy. Daily torpor, a temporally controlled reduction of the metabolic rate\nand body temperature, is one form of heterothermy and recent studies revealed\nthat this physiological strategy is used by many tropical and subtropical\nspecies. Yet, little is known about torpor in bats and their intraspecific\nthermoregulatory flexibility. Therefore, three populations of the Malagasy bat\nspecies Triaenops menamena were investigated, to examine their metabolic rate,\nskin temperature and related energy expenditure during normothermic and torpid\nstates in context of different microclimatic conditions. This study exposed\nsignificant physiological differences among these three populations along a\ngradient of fluctuation in environmental conditions. The greater the\nfluctuations in ambient temperature and humidity, the higher was the general\nresting metabolic rate and the rate of its reduction, but the lower was the\ntorpid metabolic rate. This species shows a highly adaptive flexibility in\ntheir physiology and are able to cope with unfavorable environmental conditions\nby using different strategies of thermoregulation and hypometabolism, which is\nbeneficial regarding ongoing climatic changes.", "field": "Quantitative Biology", "categories": "q-bio.QM"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.13022", "title": "Harmonizing the Generation and Pre-publication Stewardship of FAIR Image\n  Data", "abstract": "Together with the molecular knowledge of genes and proteins, biological\nimages promise to significantly enhance the scientific understanding of complex\ncellular systems and to advance predictive and personalized therapeutic\nproducts for human health.

The\nbasal ganglia (BG) are approximated as a single effective population and their\nroles in modulating oscillatory corticothalamic (CT) dynamics and vice versa\nare analyzed. Besides normal EEG rhythms, enhanced activity around 4 Hz and 20\nHz exists in the model, consistent with characteristic frequencies in PD. These\nrhythms result from resonances in loops between the BG and CT populations,\nanalogous to those underlying epileptic oscillations in a previous CT model.\nDopamine depletion is argued to weaken the dampening of these resonances in PD,\nand network connections explain the significant coherence between BG, thalamic,\nand cortical activity around 4-8 Hz and 20 Hz. Parallels between the afferent\nand efferent connection sites of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and BG\npredict low dopamine to correspond to a reduced likelihood of tonic-clonic\n(grand mal) seizures, agreeing with experimental findings. Further, the model\npredicts an increased likelihood of absence (petit mal) seizure resulting from\nlow dopamine levels matching experimental findings. Suppression of absence\nseizure activity is shown when afferent and efferent BG connections to the CT\nsystem are strengthened, consistent with other CTBG modeling studies. The BG\nare demonstrated to suppress activity of the CTBG system near tonic-clonic\nseizure states, providing insight into the reported efficacy of current\ntreatments in BG circuits. Sleep states of the TRN are also found to suppress\npathological PD activity matching observations.
