Yet,\nit is unclear whether there is any common feature among different systems that\nexhibit TC. From a general timescale invariance, we show that TC relies on\nexistence of certain period-lengthening reactions wherein the period of the\nsystem increases strongly with the rates in these reactions. By studying\nseveral generic oscillator models, we show that this counter-intuitive\ndependence is nonetheless a common feature of oscillators in the nonlinear\n(far-from-onset) regime where the oscillation can be separated into fast and\nslow phases. The increase of the period with the period-lengthening reaction\nrates occurs when the amplitude of the slow phase in the oscillation increases\nwith these rates while the progression-speed in the slow phase is controlled by\nother rates of the system. The positive dependence of the period on the\nperiod-lengthening rates balances its inverse dependence on other kinetic rates\nin the system, which gives rise to robust TC in a wide range of parameters. We\ndemonstrate the existence of such period-lengthening reactions and their\nrelevance for TC in all four model systems we considered. Theoretical results\nfor a model of the Kai system are supported by experimental data. A study of\nthe energy dissipation also shows that better TC performance requires higher\nenergy consumption.
