Using a plankton pump, we examine the distribution\nof intertidal mussel larvae along three axes: alongshore, cross-shelf and by\ndepth during a large scale (600 km) cruise over the Agulhas Bank off southern\nAfrica in August/September 2010. As a general pattern, higher veliger\nabundances were found close to the coast. Our analyses of the nearshore flow,\nestimated from ADCP data and the vertical distribution of larvae, show that\nonshore larval retention may be mediated by active vertical swimming through\nthe water column guided by light and wind-induced turbulence. A massive\noffshore export of larvae off St Francis Bay was, however, observed during an\nAgulhas Current meander which influenced inner shelf waters. We hypothesize\nthat, by increasing and homogenizing flow, the Agulhas Current may erase the\neffects of larval vertical positioning on onshore retention and transport\nlarvae offshore.

In this study,\ninvertebrate larvae, currents, and hydrographic variables were sampled at\ndifferent depths during and after the presence of fronts on three different\ncruises off the southern coast of South Africa. Internal wave dynamics were\nobserved in the hydrographic data set but also through satellite imagery,\nalthough strong surface convergent currents were absent and thermal\nstratification was weak. During the first two cruises, fronts were more\nconspicuous and they preceded strong onshore currents at depth which developed\nwith the rising tide. Vertical distributions of larvae changed accordingly,\nwith higher abundances at these deep layers once the front disappeared. The\nthird cruise was carried out during slack tides, the front was not conspicuous,\ndeep strong onshore currents did not occur afterward and larval distributions\ndid not change consistently through time. Overall, the vertical distributions\nof many larval taxa matched the vertical profiles of shoreward currents and\nmultivariate analyses revealed that these flows structured the larval\ncommunity, which was neither influenced by temperature nor chlorophyll. Thus,\nthe ability to regulate active vertical positioning may enhance shoreward\nadvection and determine nearshore larval distributions.", "field": "Quantitative Biology", "categories": "q-bio.QM"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.10334", "title": "DrugAssist: A Large Language Model for Molecule Optimization", "abstract": "Recently, the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) on a\nwide range of tasks has attracted an increasing number of attempts to apply\nLLMs in drug discovery.

These non-interactive approaches overlook the fact that the\ndrug discovery process is actually one that requires the integration of expert\nexperience and iterative refinement. To address this gap, we propose\nDrugAssist, an interactive molecule optimization model which performs\noptimization through human-machine dialogue by leveraging LLM's strong\ninteractivity and generalizability. DrugAssist has achieved leading results in\nboth single and multiple property optimization, simultaneously showcasing\nimmense potential in transferability and iterative optimization.

Consequently, the accuracy of their forecasts, and their\nutility as decision-support tools is a matter of debate. In this paper, we\ncalibrate ecosystem models to time-series data from 110 different experimental\nmicrocosm ecosystems, each containing between three and five interacting\nspecies.

Our results show that for each timeseries dataset, a\nlarge number of very different parameter sets offer equivalent, good fits.\nHowever, these calibrated ecosystem models have poor predictive accuracy when\nforecasting future dynamics and offer ambiguous predictions about how species\nin the ecosystem will respond to management interventions. Closer inspection\nreveals that the ecosystem models fail because calibration cannot determine the\ntypes of interactions that occur within the ecosystem.
