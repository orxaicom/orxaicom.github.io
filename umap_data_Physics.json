Because the modulation breaks time-reversal symmetry, the\nmultiparticle energy bands of bound states have none-zero Chern number, and\nsupport topological bound edge states. In a Thouless pump, a bound state that\nuniformly occupies a topological energy band can be shifted by integer unit\ncells per cycle, consistent with the corresponding Chern number. We can also\nrealize topological pumping of bound edge state from one end to another. The\nentanglement entropy between particles rapidly increases at transition points,\nwhich is related to the spatial spread of a bounded pair. In addition, we\npropose to realize hybridized pumping with fractional displacement per cycle by\nadding an extra tilt potential to separate topological pumping of the bound\nstate and Bloch oscillations of single particle.

Recently, an ensemble bagging and\nconvex hull approximation (CHA) approach (together, BCHA) was proposed and it\nstrongly suggests employing a machine learning technique for the\nseparability-entanglement classification problem. However, BCHA does only\nincorporate the balanced dataset for classification tasks which results in\nlower average accuracy. In order to solve the data imbalance problem in the\npresent literature, an exploration of the Boosting technique has been carried\nout, and a trade-off between the Boosting and Bagging-based ensemble classifier\nis explored for quantum separability problems. For the two-qubit and two-qutrit\nquantum systems, the pros and cons of the proposed random under-sampling boost\nCHA (RUSBCHA) for the quantum separability problem are compared with the\nstate-of-the-art CHA and BCHA approaches. As the data is highly unbalanced,\nperformance measures such as overall accuracy, average accuracy, F-measure, and\nG-mean are evaluated for a fair comparison. The outcomes suggest that RUSBCHA\nis an alternative to the BCHA approach. Also, for several cases, performance\nimprovements are observed for RUSBCHA since the data is imbalanced.", "field": "Physics", "categories": "quant-ph"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.12089", "title": "Trainability of a quantum-classical machine in the NISQ era", "abstract": "Advancements in classical computing have significantly enhanced machine\nlearning applications, yet inherent limitations persist in terms of energy,\nresource and speed.
