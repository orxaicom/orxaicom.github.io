Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) provide a\nparadigmatic example, where the elementary excitations are described by\nfractional quasiparticles such as spinons. However, such fractional\nquasiparticles behave differently from electrons, making their experimental\nidentification challenging. Here, we theoretically investigate the spin Seebeck\neffect, which is a thermoelectric response via a spin current, as an efficient\nprobe of the fractional quasiparticles in QSLs, focusing on the Kitaev\nhoneycomb model. By comprehensive studies using the real-time dynamics, the\nperturbation theory, and the linear spin-wave theory based on the tunnel\nspin-current theory, we find that the spin current is induced by thermal\ngradient in the Kitaev spin liquid, via the low-energy fractional Majorana\nexcitations. This underscores the ability of Majorana fermions to carry spin\ncurrent, despite lacking spin angular momentum. Furthermore, we find that the\ninduced spin current changes its sign depending on the sign of the Kitaev\ninteraction, indicating that the Majorana fermions contribute to the spin\ncurrent with (up-)down-spin like nature when the exchange coupling is\n(anti)ferromagnetic. Thus, in contrast to the negative spin current already\nfound in a one-dimensional QSL, our finding reveals that the spin Seebeck\neffect can exhibit either positive or negative signals, contingent upon the\nnature of fractional excitations in the QSLs.

To extract\nlarge quantities of energy one needs to mount a recursive Penrose process where\nparticles are confined and can bounce back to suffer ever again a decaying\nprocess in the black hole electric ergoregion. In an asymptotically anti-de\nSitter (AdS) spacetime, two situations of confinement are possible. One\nsituation uses a reflecting mirror at some radius, which obliges the energetic\noutgoing particles to return to the decaying point. The other situation uses\nthe natural AdS property that sends back at some intrinsic returning radius\nthose outgoing energetic particles. In addition, besides the conservation laws\nthe decaying process must obey, one has to set conditions at the decaying point\nfor the particles debris. These conditions restrain the possible scenarios, but\nthere are still a great number of available scenarios for the decays. Within\nthese, we choose two scenarios, scenario 1 and scenario 2, that pertain to the\nmasses and electric charges of the final particles. Thus, in the mirror\nsituation we find that scenario 1 leads to a black hole energy factory, and\nscenario 2 ends in a black hole bomb. In the no mirror situation, i.e., pure\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om-AdS, scenario 1 leads again to a black hole energy\nfactory, but scenario 2 yields no bomb. This happens because the volume in\nwhich the particles are confined increases to infinity along the chain of\ndecays, leading to a zero value of the extracted energy per unit volume and the\nbomb is demined. The whole treatment performed here involves no backreaction on\nthe black hole mass and electric charge, nevertheless we speculate that the end\nstate of the recursive process is a Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om-AdS black hole with\nvery short hair, i.e., with one particle at rest at some definite radius.", "field": "Physics", "categories": "gr-qc,astro-ph.HE,hep-th"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.13075", "title": "The 0th and 2nd Laws of Black Hole Mechanics in Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar\n  Effective Field Theory", "abstract": "There has been recent progress in extending the 0th and 2nd laws of black\nhole mechanics to gravitational effective field theories (EFTs).

Employing different Husimi\nfunctions, our study focuses on both the $\\alpha$-type, which is canonically\nequivalent to the celebrated H\\'enon-Heiles Hamiltonian, a nonintegrable and\nmixed-type system, and the general case at the saddle energy where the system\nis fully chaotic. Based on Husimi quantum surface of sections (QSOS), we find\nthat in the mixed-type system, the fraction of mixed eigenstates in an energy\nshell $[E-\\delta E/2, E+\\delta E/2]$ with $\\delta E\\ll E$ shows a power-law\ndecay with respect to the decreasing Planck constant $\\hbar$. Defining the\nlocalization measures in terms of the R\\'enyi-Wehrl entropy, in both the\nmixed-type and fully chaotic systems, we find a better fit with the beta\ndistribution and a lesser degree of localization, in the distribution of\nlocalization measures of chaotic eigenstates, as the controlling ratio\n$\\alpha_\\mathcal{L} = t_H /t_T$ between the Heisenberg time $t_H$ and the\nclassical transport time $t_T$ increases. This transition with respect to\n$\\alpha_\\mathcal{L}$ and the power-law decay of the mixed states, together\nprovide supporting evidence for the principle of uniform semiclassical\ncondensation (PUSC) in the semiclassical limit. Moreover, we find that in the\ngeneral case which is fully chaotic, the maximally localized state, is\ninfluenced by the stable and unstable manifold of the saddles (hyperbolic fixed\npoints), while the maximally extended state notably avoids these points,\nextending across the remaining space, complementing each other.", "field": "Physics", "categories": "quant-ph,cond-mat.stat-mech"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.13122", "title": "Brief Theory of Multiqubit Measurement", "abstract": "Peculiarities of multiqubit measurement are for the most part similar to\npeculiarities of measurement for qudit -- quantum object with\nfinite-dimensional Hilbert space.
