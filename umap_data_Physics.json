After establishing the generic framework, we focus\non two important categories of communication complexity tasks - the general\nversion of random access codes and equality problems defined by graphs. We\nderive lower bounds on the distinguishability of the sender's input as a\nfunction of the success metric of these tasks in classical communication.\nNotably, we show that the ratio between the distinguishability in classical and\nquantum communication to achieve the same success metric escalates with the\ncomplexity of these tasks, reaching arbitrarily large values. Besides, we\ndemonstrate the quantum advantage by employing qubits in solving equality\nproblems associated with odd-cycle graphs. Furthermore, we derive lower bounds\non distinguishability for another class of communication tasks, namely,\npair-distinguishability tasks, and present several instances of the quantum\nadvantage.", "field": "Physics", "categories": "quant-ph"}, {"arxiv_id": "2401.12968", "title": "The classical limit of Quantum Max-Cut", "abstract": "It is well-known in physics that the limit of large quantum spin $S$ should\nbe understood as a semiclassical limit. This raises the question of whether\nsuch emergent classicality facilitates the approximation of computationally\nhard quantum optimization problems, such as the local Hamiltonian problem. We\ndemonstrate this explicitly for spin-$S$ generalizations of Quantum Max-Cut\n($\\mathrm{QMaxCut}_S$), equivalent to the problem of finding the ground state\nenergy of an arbitrary spin-$S$ quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet\n($\\mathrm{AFH}_S$).

We also present two distinct families of classical\napproximation algorithms for $\\mathrm{QMaxCut}_S$ based on rounding the output\nof a semidefinite program to a product of Bloch coherent states.
